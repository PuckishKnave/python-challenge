The total number of months included in the dataset  
 The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period  
 The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period    
 The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period      
 The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period     

PyBank should then print these calculations to both the terminal and export them into a text file called analysis_results.txt

For PyPoll the purpose is to analyze election data and calculate the following:

The total number of votes cast  
A complete list of candidates who received votes  
The percentage of votes each candidate won
